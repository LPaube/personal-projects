This timer is my first project that reunites html, css, and javascript. It makes use of the following notable technologies/techniques:

- Vanilla javascript for the functionality of the timers, and to hide/show elements depending on the tool selected:
  - Date handling (Date object)
  - Time handling (setInterval method)
  - Event listeners (AddEventListener method)
  - DOM manipulation (getElementById method)
 
- Vanilla CSS:
  - CSS variables
  - FontAwesome icons
  - flexbox (display: flex)

- Vanilla HTML
